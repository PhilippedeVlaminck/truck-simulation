Welcome to the truck simulation tool.

This tool allows you the research the optimal configuration for your trucking process.

The following options are available:
- Arrival shedule: controls for number of trucks per day, arrival distribution and opening hours resulting in the generated hourly sheduled that will be used in the simulation.
- Simulation speed: from realtime to 10000x current time.
- Braching times: controls for the self service (kiosk) success rates dictating howmany drivers will pass without having arrival rework at the dispatcher.
- Travel times: here you can set howlong it will take a truck / driver to travel from one server to another
- Servers & service times: set the number of servers and the respective service normtime range

How to use?
The idea is to set an as realistic as possible baseline and run the simulation. In the results you will find what kind of queuing is being caused and what the resulting TTAT would be of the input parameter.
